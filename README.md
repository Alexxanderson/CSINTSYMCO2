# Medical Chatbot - Prolog
Welcome to the Medical Chatbot built on Prolog! This chatbot is designed to assist users in diagnosing medical conditions based on provided symptoms. The chatbot utilizes Prolog, a logic programming language, to query a database of medical knowledge and provide relevant diagnoses.
